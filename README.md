msg.setText("Hey, so a made a few changes, and if you're up to it, take a look at [Quill & Quiver] (https://quillandquiver.wixsite.com/quillandquiver/about) with a winter-y theme. It's not quite winter yet where I live, but it is getting pretty cold, and I just couldn't resist. It should also be a lot easier to navigate on mobile. Let me know what you think! I'm open to any ideas any of you have, either making some QOL changes to the site, or challenges, basically anything you've got.");
